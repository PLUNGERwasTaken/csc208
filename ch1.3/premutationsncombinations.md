# Premutations and Combinations
## Premuations
Premutations are a list of all possible combinaitons in a set:

- Example: there are 6 possible combinations with the set *a,b,c* 

abc, acb, bac, bca, cab, cba

How might this be represetnted mathmatically?

- As you mightve expected it can be represented as 3 * 2 * 1 

- Premutations can be represented with factorials if there are no interuptions

$$5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 5!$$
$$5 * 4 * 3 â‰  5! $$
