# Premutations and Combinations
## Premuations
Premutations are a list of all possible combinaitons in a set:

- Example: there are 6 possible combinations with the set *a,b,c* 

abc, acb, bac, bca, cab, cba

How might this be represetnted mathmatically?

- As you mightve expected it can be represented as 3 * 2 * 1 

- Premutations can be represented with factorials if there are no interuptions

$$5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 5!$$

$$5 * 4 * 3 ≠ 5!$$

Premutations with interuptions can be read as P(n,k) or P(n-k) or to follow the format of the previous example, P(8,5) or P(8-5)

Examples:
    P(n,k):

$$P(8,5) = 8 * 7 * 6$$

- *NOTE*: Never simplfy a premutations notation, P(5 - 2) ≠ P(3)
