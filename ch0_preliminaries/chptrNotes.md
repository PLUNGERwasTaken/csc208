much of all the information we're learning is from prob and stats so recall that

Entry: term for the individual data that can be found in a quesiton

Set: a string of Entrys/ data characterised by {} and sparced by commas.

Functions:
- = Equals - Not needed to be explained much further but means equals
- ∈ Belongs to - represented by the epsilon like character often used to say this set belongs to this another set

Operations:
- ∪ Union - will combine two sets but does not make overlapping entries
- ∩ Intersection - Will make a set of only the overlapping entries (output still doesnt have overlapping values though)
- / Diffrence - Outputs only entries not found in the Denominator from the Numerator
- _ Overline - Subset, selfexplanatory
