# Summary of Operations on Sets
## Union 
### Notation:
A ∪ B = {x}
- Result is the set of all elements of both A and B
- ∪ is a pretty clear representation of the U in Union
## Intersection
### Notation:
A ∩ B = {x}
- Result is the set of all elements both A and B share
- You can remember Intersection as being the opposite of Union but NOT the contrapostive
## Complement:
### Notation:
A = _B
- The Result is the Elements of B are are a compliment of A
- Remembering compliment is easy, as its just a line but if you need to think of the set or element being under the roof of the superior element
- *_Note: __ is meant to represent an Upperline, or a Line over. as UTF-8 (or whatever is used) doesnt support Upperlines too my knowledge_
## Diffrence:
### Notation:
A/B = {x}
- The result is the Elments of A NOT in B
- Remembering this is also easy as youre literally divinding the two

### Example:
- If A = {1,2,3,6,7,0} and B = {2,3,4,5,6,8,9,10} then A ∩ B = {2,3,6}
- Aswell A/B = {1,7,0}
- And B/A = {4,5,8,9,10}
- A ∪ B = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}
