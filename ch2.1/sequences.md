# Describing Sequences
## Sequences
A sequence is an ordered list. 
The easiest example is :
$$0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...$$
Although yes this is a identical to set N theyre not the same as the order is important.

We can abbreviate these sets using a form like:
$$(a<sub>n</sub>)<sub>n \in \natrual</sub>$$
