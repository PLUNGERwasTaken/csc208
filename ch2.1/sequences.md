# Describing Sequences
## Sequences
A sequence is an ordered list. 
The easiest example is :
$$0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...$$
Although yes this is a identical to set $\mathbb{N}$ theyre not the same as the order is important.

We can abbreviate these sets using a form like:
$$(a_n )_n \in \mathbb{N} $$

<i>These Formulas fit into 2 types:</i>
<b>Closed Formulas:</b> A Closed formula has a finate amout of changes to n, really mean it doesnt really commit changes to n at all.

<b>Recursive Formulas:</b> A Recursive formula has a recurance relation: an attribute that relates a part of the formula to a previous iteration of the formula. And an Initial Condition: defined orginial formula.

>Closed Formula Example:
>
>$$ a_n = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} $$

>Recursive Formula Example:
>
>Recurance Relation: 
>$$a_n = 2a_n-1$$
>Inital:
>$$a_0 = 1$$
