# Euler Paths and circuits
- An Euler Path is a graph that uses every edge atleast once

- A euler Circuit is a graph that starts and stops at the same vertex

- You can see if a graph is eulerian if you just follow the edges with your finger

- You can determine if a graph is eulerian aswell if it has a vertices in the odd degree, as they can not be stopprf there, making it difficult to be euler path

- aswell the converse is true if every vertice in a graph has an even degree it must be a euler circuit and if there are two vertexes with an odd degree you'll get a euler path.

## KÃ¶nigsberg's bridge

- The book doesn't explain this at all but essentially its the the question if you have a moat many brodges how do you use all of the bridges exactly once, this is mant to question euler paths and circuits as whole.
