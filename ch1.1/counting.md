# additive principle and multiplicitive

 - the **additive principle** says that if A can occur in m ways, and  B can occur in n disjoint ways, then the event “A or B” can occur in m + n ways

 - these two events must be disjoint

 - the additive principle works for any number of disjoint events.

 - the **multiplictive principle** says if event A can occur in m ways and each possibility of A allows for n ways of event B, then "A and B" can occur in m · n ways

 - mulptiplicative principle applies to more then two events

# Counting with sets
in a set with no overlapping items: $$|A| \cup B | = |A| +|B|$$

The Multiplicitive principle can be rephrased as: $$A \times B = \{(x,y): x \in A \land y \in B\}$$

This will give us a indered par where x is from A and y is from B

this introduces us to cartesian products

cardinality can be proven through the statement:

$$|A \times B| = |A| * |B|$$

Cardinality in sets unioned can be found through:

$$|A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cup B|$$
