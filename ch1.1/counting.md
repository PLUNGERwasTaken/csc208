# additive principle and multiplicitive

 - the **additive principle** says that if A can occur in m ways, and  B can occur in n disjoint ways, then the event “A or B” can occur in m + n ways

 - these two events must be disjoint

 - the additive principle works for any number of disjoint events.

 - the **multiplictive principle** says if event A can occur in m ways and each possibility of A allows for n ways of event B, then "A and B" can occur in m · n ways
 
 - mulptiplicative principle applies to more then two events
