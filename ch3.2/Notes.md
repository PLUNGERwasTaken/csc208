# Direct Proof
Direct proof is essentially proof via arguement.
For Example: Assume $A$, talk, talk, talk, Therefore $B$.
It's the simpiliest and suttlest proof.
# Proof by Contrapositive
Proof by Contrapositive is the equivelence of Direct Proof:
Assume $-B$, yap, yap, yap, Therefore $-A.$
# Proof by Contradiciton
If youre ever in a situation where a statement can be rephrased into an implication (irrational numbers) you can prove the inverse:
Assume $-A$, blah, blah, blah, Therefore $B$
It must proove a contradiciton to work, then the only conclusion is that $-A$ is false and $A$ is true.
If $A$ cant flase then it must be true.
# Proof by Counter Example
You cant prove something using just an example if you have an existential statement, you can disprove it.
# Proof by Cases
In the simpliset terms its trying to prove P is true by proving that $Q \implies P$ and that $\lnot Q \implies P$
